# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
The proposed idea is that of a ‘Automated Traffic Management System’
- The traffic light duration is calculated using a model calculating weighted mean of the following factors :- 
\
a) The congestion coefficient calculated using image recognition applied on live feed captured by cctv cameras
\
b) Live location and bearing angle of the approaching emergency vehicle from the nearest traffic signal

## API's used
